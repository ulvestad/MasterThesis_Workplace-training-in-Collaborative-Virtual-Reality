\chapter{Phase 3: Last Requirements and Finishing Up} \label{chap:7}
\label{chap:phase3}

\section{Planning and Changes}
Phase 3 was originally meant to contain changes and finishing touches based on the feedback received during phase 2. However, just as the main testing was about to begin, Norway took measures to combat Covid-19, effectively preventing us from going through with the plans that were laid out for this phase. Coupled with an enforced work from home situation, and the plan needed to be changed drastically. Primarily, some triage had to be done as to figure out which parts of the application were the most necessary for remote data gathering. Since the application is a proof of concept, it was never that important that it ran without supervision, or that multiple server instances could be ran at the same time, since we were always present to run the tests and could manage all of this manually. Now that could no longer be assured.
